# Fractals
The project on Python and TKinter implementing Pifagor's Tree via rotation matrix.

It's common fractals implementation.

Interesting components:

1) Pathagor's tree building
2) Math part about translating coordinates systems from real to virtual (as we can see it)
3) Math part about rotation and rotation matrix
